    <h1>This is the largest heading.</h1>

    <!-- a new line is inserted after a heading -->

    <h2>This is the second largest heading.</h2>

    <h6>Headings go down to this level.</h6>

    <p>The p tag is for paragraphs.</p>

    <p>Paragraphs can go on for many lines. It is good
      to know that a new line is inserted after a paragraph
      too. We will talk more about this later but
      paragraphs and headings are called "block" elements.
      A new line is inserted after a "block" element.
      "In-line" elements don't have a new line inserted after
      them.</p>
